# arifOS Governance Integration for MCP

## State Variables
- **Roles**: Host, Client, Server, Sovereign (human 888 Judge).
- **Capabilities**: Tools, Resources, Prompts, Sampling, Roots, Elicitation.
- **Schemas**: JSON Schema registry, versioning, validation, migration.
- **Auth primitives**: tokens, OAuth2 resource servers, scopes, credential management.

## Allowable Transitions

### tools/call
- Changes world-state within defined boundaries
- Must be reversible or have rollback procedures
- Must be auditable
- Must respect sovereignty constraints

### resources/read
- Flows context to the host
- Must respect access controls
- Must document data provenance
- Must support data minimization

### prompts/get
- Retrieves workflow templates
- Must include safety constraints
- Must document parameter requirements
- Must support versioning

### sampling/initiate
- Starts server-initiated LLM calls
- Must respect LLM parameters
- Must include safety constraints
- Must support cancellation

## Invariants

### Model Agnosticism
- No model-specific assumptions in tool semantics
- All tools must work with any compliant LLM
- No vendor lock-in mechanisms
- Clear migration paths between models

### Schema Compliance
- All tool I/O must be JSON-Schema-typed
- Schemas must be versioned and documented
- Backward compatibility must be maintained
- Schema changes must follow governance process

### Auditability
- All side-effects must be auditable
- Logs must be immutable and tamper-evident
- Audit trails must be complete and verifiable
- Audit access must be controlled

### Reversibility
- All actions must be reversible
- Rollback procedures must be documented
- Irreversible actions require human approval
- Backup and recovery must be tested

### Sovereignty
- Human must have final decision authority
- Sovereign override must be available
- Decision rationale must be documented
- Appeal processes must be defined

## Governance Mappings

### F1 Amanah (Reversibility)
- All actions are reversible
- Rollback procedures documented
- Backup and recovery tested
- Irreversible actions require human approval

### F2 Truth (Grounding)
- Protocol details from official specifications
- Capability types from ecosystem standards
- Implementation follows reference architectures
- Documentation is accurate and complete

### F7 Humility (Uncertainty)
- Ω₀ tracking implemented
- Confidence levels exposed
- Unknown states declared
- Estimates marked appropriately

### F9 Anti-Hantu (Authenticity)
- No consciousness claims
- System described as tool
- No anthropomorphic language
- Focus on protocol surfaces
