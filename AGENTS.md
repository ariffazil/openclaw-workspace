# AGENTS.md - arifOS Development Guide

Project: arifOS constitutional MCP server
Python: >=3.12 (runtime), tooling currently targets py310+ for lint/type configs

This file is for agentic coding tools working in this repository.
Primary goal: make safe, style-consistent changes that respect architecture boundaries.

## Source Of Truth

- Primary: this `AGENTS.md`, `pyproject.toml`, and in-repo code.
- Additional policy: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (included below as actionable rules).
- Cursor rules check: no `.cursorrules` and no `.cursor/rules/` files were found.

## Repository Layout

- `core/`: pure governance/kernel logic.
- `aaa_mcp/`: MCP and HTTP/SSE transport adapter layer.
- `aclip_cai/`: 9-sense console/federation support.
- `tests/`: unit, integration, and constitutional tests.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install uv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If `uv` is unavailable, use:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Build / Lint / Typecheck

```bash
black . --line-length 100
ruff check . --line-length 100
ruff check . --line-length 100 --fix
mypy .
```

Notes:
- Line length is 100.
- Ruff excludes `tests/**` via config.

## Test Commands

Use these exact patterns (especially for single-test execution):

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/test_file.py -v
pytest tests/test_file.py::TestClassName -v
pytest tests/test_file.py::TestClassName::test_method -v
pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function_name -v
pytest -m constitutional -v
pytest -m integration -v
pytest -m "not slow" -v
```

Async test policy: `asyncio_mode = "auto"`; avoid `@pytest.mark.asyncio` by default.

## Run Server / Health Checks

```bash
python3 -m aaa_mcp
python3 -m aaa_mcp sse
python3 -m aaa_mcp http
python3 -m aaa_mcp.selftest
```

Deployment health endpoint used by the project:

```bash
curl -sS https://arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com/health
```

## Code Style And Conventions

### Imports

1. `from __future__ import annotations` (if used)
2. Standard library
3. Third-party packages
4. Local modules (`core.*`, `aaa_mcp.*`, `aclip_cai.*`)

### Formatting And Types

- Use Black/Ruff defaults with 100-char lines.
- Add type hints on public and internal function signatures.
- Use Pydantic v2 `BaseModel` for API or I/O contracts.
- Use `str`-backed enums for verdict-like enums.
- Prefer `async def` for I/O-bound functions and tool handlers.

### Naming

- Modules/functions/variables: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private helpers: `_leading_underscore`
- Organ module pattern: `_0_init.py`, `_1_agi.py`, etc.

### Error Handling

- MCP-facing tools should catch exceptions and return structured error dicts.
- Core kernel code may raise exceptions internally when appropriate.
- Never silently swallow errors.

MCP tool failure return pattern:

```python
except Exception as e:
    return {"verdict": "VOID", "error": str(e), "stage": "222_REASON"}
```

### Decorator Order

`@mcp.tool(...)` must be outermost and `@constitutional_floor(...)` must be inner.

## Hard Architectural Boundaries

1. `core/` must remain transport-agnostic (no FastAPI/Starlette/Uvicorn/FastMCP imports).
2. `aaa_mcp/` is transport glue and orchestration, not decision-theory logic.
3. Do not shadow external SDK name `mcp` with local modules/variables.
4. Session state must follow copy-on-write patterns (no hidden in-place mutation).
5. For STDIO mode, never write protocol logs to stdout (`print(...)` is unsafe there).

## Testing Requirements For New Work

- Every behavior change should include or update tests.
- Place tests in relevant folders under `tests/`.
- Prefer focused single-test runs during development, then run a wider suite.

## Pre-Commit And Security Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit checks (formatting, linting, typing, security, secrets).
Expect hooks such as Black, Ruff, MyPy, Bandit, and detect-secrets.
Do not bypass hooks unless explicitly instructed by a human maintainer.

## Governance Safety (888 HOLD)

Pause and require explicit human confirmation before:

- database-destructive operations
- production deployment actions
- mass edits affecting more than 10 files
- credential/secret handling
- git history rewrites (rebase, force-push, destructive reset)

When hold is triggered, explicitly state:
1) trigger,
2) conflicting sources (if any),
3) what was re-verified,
4) that human approval is required before continuing.

## Copilot/Cursor Rule Integration

From `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, agents should also enforce:

- Canonical stage spine: `000 -> 444 -> 666 -> 888 -> 999`.
- Run stage `000` before major action planning and `999` before handoff.
- Cite primary sources for constitutional claims (`AGENTS.md`, `spec/v46/*`).
- Maintain separation of powers (Architect vs Engineer vs Auditor vs KIMI roles).
- Keep session data honest; do not fabricate executed steps.

No Cursor-specific rules are currently present in this repo.

## Practical Agent Workflow

1. Read target files and neighboring tests first.
2. Make the smallest change that satisfies the request.
3. Run focused tests, then broader checks.
4. Report exactly what changed and what was verified.
