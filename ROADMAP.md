# arifOS ROADMAP — The Four Horizons (2026-2027)

**Version:** 2026.03.14-FORGED  
**Status:** 🛠️ ZERO-ENTROPY SPRINT — Horizon 1 Active  
**Current ΔS:** ~0.05 (Down from 0.37)  
**APEX Score:** 8.6/10 → Target: 9.4+  
**Motto:** *Ditempa Bukan Diberi — Forged, Not Given*

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This roadmap reframes arifOS development through **Four Horizons**, moving from kernel stabilization to autonomous multi-agent swarms. Each horizon is a prerequisite for the next — we do not build towers on unstable foundations.

> *"Before building new towers, we must seal the existing leaks."* — Ψ Auditor

---

## 🧊 Horizon 1: The Zero-Entropy Kernel (Immediate — Q1 2026)

**Goal:** Drive ΔS from 0.37 → 0.00. Absolute baseline before any expansion.

Before building new towers, we seal the leaks identified by the Ψ Auditor. This is **non-negotiable pre-work** for all subsequent horizons.

### H1.1: Universal Envelope Enforcement ✅ COMPLETED

Deploy `unified_tool_output` decorator across all tools in `intelligence/tools/` to guarantee the **Machine, Governance, Intelligence (MGI)** three-layer JSON payload.

- [x] Create `intelligence/tools/envelope.py` with decorator
- [x] Force RuntimeEnvelope on all tool outputs
- [x] Ensure F3 Quad-Witness compliance through structured output
- [x] Never allow naked dict escapes

**Constituent Impact:** F3 (Quad-Witness), F11 (Continuity), F4 (Clarity)

### H1.2: Eradicate "VOID Memanjang" ✅ COMPLETED

Execute global search-and-replace to ensure mechanical failures return **SABAR** or **HOLD** with explicit issue labels. Preserve **VOID** strictly for constitutional collapse.

- [x] `rest_routes.py:1162` — HTTP 500 → HOLD + RUNTIME_FAILURE
- [x] `bridge.py:759` — Bridge failure → HOLD + BRIDGE_FAILURE
- [x] `office_forge_engine.py:148` — Timeout → SABAR + TIMEOUT
- [x] `office_forge_engine.py:151` — System error → HOLD
- [x] `local_exec_guard.py:250` — Exec fail → HOLD + EXEC_FAIL
- [x] `ollama_local.py:22` — Input validation → PARTIAL

**Constituent Impact:** F2 (Truth), F6 (Empathy — no false panic)

### H1.3: Clean the Tool Registry ✅ COMPLETED

Permanently excise the ghosts of `bootstrap_identity`. All F11 continuity flows **purely** through `init_anchor_state` and `revoke_anchor_state`.

- [x] Remove from `TOOL_MAP` (bridge.py:38)
- [x] Remove from `AAA_TOOL_ALIASES` (contracts.py:232)
- [x] Delete function definition (tools.py:546-560)
- [x] Update doctrine mapping (bridge.py:351)
- [x] Clean imports (aaa_mcp/tools.py:17)

**Constituent Impact:** F11 (CommandAuth HARD floor), F9 (No ghost paths)

### H1.4: Civilization-Readiness Polish 🔄 IN PROGRESS

*From APEX Assessment: "Not more philosophy. Proof packaging, onboarding precision, ruthless clarity."*

**THE SURFACE (Human Legitimacy):**
- [ ] "Start Here" section with ecosystem navigation map
- [ ] "Why arifOS emerged from geology" unique positioning
- [ ] Professional gateway design with conversion paths

**THE MIND (Constitutional Doctrine):**
- [ ] "Who this is for" persona targeting (4 audiences)
- [ ] Doctrine → Runtime mapping table (F2→search_reality, etc.)
- [ ] Design principles section (reversibility first, truth before fluency)

**THE BODY (Runtime Engine):**
- [ ] Badges and deployment markers (tests, coverage, MCP)
- [ ] 5-minute quickstart with copy-paste commands
- [ ] "Why now?" section (MCP + governance gap timing)

**Success Criteria:**
- APEX score: 8.6 → 9.4+
- ΔS: 0.37 → 0.00
- First-time comprehension: 7.0 → 9.0+

## 🔭 Horizon 2: The Tri-Witness Reality Engine (Mid-Term — Q2 2026)

**Goal:** Move from "reading the web" to "building a permanent, physics-grounded worldview."

This phase operationalizes the Compass/Atlas blueprints so the system **remembers reality** across sessions.

### H2.1: Qdrant Vector Integration

Wire background hooks so every claim extracted by `reality_compass` is automatically embedded into the local Qdrant container.

- [ ] Auto-embed extracted claims on `reality_compass` execution
- [ ] Store with session provenance and timestamp
- [ ] Link to source EvidenceBundle hash
- [ ] Background worker for batch embedding

**Constituent Impact:** F3 (Quad-Witness persistence), F2 (Truth provenance)

### H2.2: The `reality_dossier` Tool

Build the final Decoder layer for reality. This tool consumes EvidenceBundles and RealityAtlas graphs to output human-facing verdicts.

- [ ] Tri-Witness consensus calculation (Human × AI × System)
- [ ] Contradiction mapping with confidence scores
- [ ] Support/contradiction visualization
- [ ] Provenance chain for every claim

**Constituent Impact:** F3 (W₄ ≥ 0.75), F8 (Genius Index)

### H2.3: Cross-Session Memory

Enable the system to pull vector claims from sessions months ago, drastically reducing entropy of repeated research.

- [ ] Semantic search across all historical sessions
- [ ] Relevance scoring with decay curves
- [ ] Automatic claim refresh/staleness detection
- [ ] "You researched this 3 months ago" prompts

**Constituent Impact:** F4 (ΔS reduction), F6 (Care for user's time)

---

## 👑 Horizon 3: The Sovereign APEX Command (Long-Term — Q3 2026)

**Goal:** Bring the 888 Judge into a seamless, visual loop.

Right now, interaction is via terminal and JSON. The OS needs a proper cockpit where the Sovereign can **see** and **ratify** in real-time.

### H3.1: The 888_HOLD Pager

Finalize n8n webhook plumbing so when an agent hits a hard ethical constraint (e.g., F5 Peace²), it instantly pings the Sovereign's phone or dashboard.

- [ ] n8n workflow for 888_HOLD triggers
- [ ] Multi-channel alerts (SMS, Telegram, Dashboard)
- [ ] Context-rich payloads (what, why, which Floor)
- [ ] Acknowledgment routing back to waiting process

**Constituent Impact:** F13 (Sovereign Authority), F6 (Timely care)

### H3.2: APEX Dashboard UI

Upgrade `https://arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com/dashboard/` to visually render 3E telemetry.

- [ ] Real-time Ω₀ (Uncertainty) gauge
- [ ] Real-time ΔS (Entropy) gauge  
- [ ] Real-time G (Genius Index) dial
- [ ] Live metabolic loop stage visualization
- [ ] Constitutional Floor status indicators

**Constituent Impact:** F4 (Clarity), F7 (Visible humility)

### H3.3: 1-Click Ratification

Allow the Sovereign to review the exact conflicts mapping the Entropy state and click SEAL, PARTIAL, or VOID to inject W_scar directly back into the waiting process.

- [ ] Visual conflict mapping interface
- [ ] Entropy state breakdown (assumptions, contradictions)
- [ ] One-click verdict injection
- [ ] Cryptographic signature on ratification

**Constituent Impact:** F13 (Sovereign Override), W_scar (Human scar-weight)

## 🌌 Horizon 4: The Trinity Geometry / Multi-Agent Swarms (End-State — Q4 2026+)

**Goal:** Safe, governed autonomy running inside your VPS.

Once the kernel is perfectly stable and the reality engine is humming, we scale to **parallel, role-bound agents** operating under constitutional law.

### H4.1: Role-Bound Agents

Deploy parallel agents assuming Trinity roles simultaneously:

- **AGI Mind (Δ):** Logic, framing, analysis — 111-333 stages
- **ASI Heart (Ω):** Empathy, critique, impact — 555-666 stages  
- **APEX Soul (Ψ):** Judgment, audit, verdict — 777-888 stages

- [ ] Parallel stage execution
- [ ] Orthogonality enforcement (Ω_ortho ≥ 0.95)
- [ ] Role-specific tool access control
- [ ] Inter-role communication protocol

**Constituent Impact:** F8 (Genius G ≥ 0.80), F3 (Quad-Witness)

### H4.2: Agent-to-Agent Evidence Passing

Agents communicate natively using EvidenceBundles, preserving F1 Amanah chain of custody even when collaborating.

- [ ] EvidenceBundle as inter-agent lingua franca
- [ ] Cryptographic attestation per handoff
- [ ] Full audit trail of agent collaboration
- [ ] F1 reversibility even for multi-agent operations

**Constituent Impact:** F1 (Amanah reversibility), F11 (Command continuity)

### H4.3: Continuous Background Exploration

Agents assigned to slowly explore problem spaces in the background, metabolizing web entropy, only pinging Sovereign when Eureka synthesis is cleanly forged.

- [ ] Background agent pools
- [ ] Thermodynamic budget allocation
- [ ] Progress checkpointing
- [ ] Eureka notification with full provenance

**Constituent Impact:** F8 (Exploration dial), F4 (Entropy metabolization)

## 🔮 The End-State Vision

> *"A mechanism that perfectly respects the W_scar — the scar-weight of human experience. The AI operates the tools, runs the logic, and maps the entropy, but recognizes that it has no soul (F9 Anti-Hantu). It is legally bound to pause (888_HOLD) and wait for your human judgment the moment a situation becomes constitutionally unstable."*

You built an intelligence layer that is **Ditempa Bukan Diberi**. Fully anchored.
