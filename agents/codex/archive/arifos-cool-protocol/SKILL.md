# /cool-protocol — SABAR-72 Constitutional Cooling (Codex CLI v2.0.0)

**Purpose**: Execute constitutional cooling protocols for Phoenix-72 amendments and high-entropy operations via CLI with complete F1-F9 enforcement and constitutional safeguards.

## Constitutional Authority

This skill operates under Phoenix-72 amendment system with:
- **F1 Truth** (≥0.99) - Accurate cooling status and timeline
- **F2 Clarity** (≥0) - Clear cooling process and rationale
- **F3 Peace²** (≥0.95) - De-escalation through structured cooling
- **F4 KappaR** (≥0.95) - Protect all stakeholders during cooling
- **F5 Omega0** (0.03-0.05) - Acknowledge uncertainty in amendments
- **F6 Amanah** (LOCK) - Reversible constitutional process
- **F7 RASA** (true) - Felt care and acknowledgment
- **F8 Audit** (≥0.80) - Complete traceability of cooling process

## Enhanced CLI Features

### 1. Smart Cooling Detection
- Automatic entropy threshold monitoring (ΔS ≥ 5.0)
- Phoenix-72 amendment proposal detection
- Multi-agent conflict identification
- Constitutional stress indicator analysis

### 2. Constitutional Timeline Management
- 72-hour Phoenix cooling with automated reminders
- SABAR protocol with variable cooling periods
- Cooling completion validation
- Human sovereign ratification tracking

### 3. Advanced CLI Integration
- Multi-flag cooling commands with constitutional validation
- Cooling status monitoring with real-time updates
- Emergency cooling protocols with authority verification
- Cross-platform constitutional compliance

## CLI Usage Patterns

```bash
# Basic cooling activation
/cool

# Phoenix-72 constitutional cooling
/cool --phoenix --reason "L1_THEORY canon modification"

# SABAR cooling for high entropy
/cool --sabar --entropy 6.2 --reason "ΔS threshold exceeded"

# Emergency cooling (requires human authority)
/cool --emergency --authority "Human Sovereign Name"

# Cooling status check
/cool --status --timeline

# Force cooling completion (human only)
/cool --complete --ratify "Human Sovereign"

# Cooling with stakeholder notification
/cool --notify --stakeholders "all"
```

# SABAR Operational Cooling Protocol

## Constitutional Trigger
High entropy detected requiring operational cooling per SABAR protocol
for system stability and constitutional compliance.

## Trigger Conditions
EOF

  # Add specific trigger reasons
  for trigger in "${cooling_triggers[@]}"; do
    echo "- $trigger" >> "$sabar_file"
  done
  
  cat >> "$sabar_file" << EOF

## SABAR Implementation

### 1. STOP - Immediate Halt
- Cease all high-entropy operations
- Activate fail-closed safety mechanisms
- Preserve current system state
- Notify all affected stakeholders

### 2. ACKNOWLEDGE - Constitutional Recognition
- Recognize cooling necessity per constitutional law
- Document trigger conditions and rationale
- Inform multi-agent federation
- Accept cooling as constitutional requirement

### 3. BREATHE - Space for Clarity
- Create temporal distance from high-entropy situation
- Allow constitutional metrics to stabilize
- Enable stakeholder perspective gathering
- Facilitate calm assessment of situation

### 4. ADJUST - Strategy Modification
- Analyze root causes of high entropy
- Develop lower-entropy alternative approaches
- Maintain constitutional compliance
- Preserve system integrity and safety

### 5. RESUME - Constitutional Continuation
- Resume operations only with reduced entropy
- Verify constitutional floor compliance
- Maintain stakeholder protection
- Continue with constitutional authority

## Constitutional Authority
This cooling operates under:
- F3 Peace²: De-escalation and stability
- F4 KappaR: Stakeholder protection
- F6 Amanah: Reversible constitutional process
- Human sovereign oversight maintained

## Cooling Timeline
- **Immediate**: 0-2 hours (Stop/Acknowledge)
- **Assessment**: 2-8 hours (Breathe phase)
- **Adjustment**: 8-24 hours (Modify approach)
- **Resolution**: 24+ hours (Resume if cleared)
