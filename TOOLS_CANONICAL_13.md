## AGENTS 11 vs Runtime 13 Reconciliation

777/888 canonical directive (Arif):
- `777` = EUREKA FORGE
- `888` = APEX Judge Metabolic Layer

Baseline divergence:
- runtime currently presents `eureka_forge` as `888_FORGE`
- runtime currently presents `apex_judge` as `777-888`

AGENTS-listed verbs (11):
- `anchor, reason, integrate, respond, validate, align, forge, audit, seal, search, fetch`

Runtime canonical public tools (13):
- `anchor_session, reason_mind, recall_memory, simulate_heart, critique_thought, apex_judge, eureka_forge, seal_vault, search_reality, fetch_content, inspect_file, audit_rules, check_vital`

Observed mapping drift:
- many legacy verbs are now aliases or folded flows (`integrate/respond` folded into `reason_mind`; `forge/audit` folded into `apex_judge` path)
- utility surface expanded beyond AGENTS 11-list

Missing-2 request tracking (from AGENTS baseline):
- `[RESEARCH NEEDED]` canonical governance ratification for the two extra utility endpoints beyond AGENTS list: `inspect_file`, `check_vital`
- `[RESEARCH NEEDED]` confirm whether AGENTS should be upgraded to explicit 13-tool canonical names (current text remains legacy-verb oriented)

## Alias and Deprecation Hints (baseline only)

From `aaa_mcp/protocol/tool_naming.py`:
- canonical -> legacy examples:
  - `anchor_session -> init_gate`
  - `reason_mind -> agi_reason`
  - `simulate_heart -> asi_empathize`
  - `apex_judge -> apex_verdict`
  - `seal_vault -> vault_seal`
- legacy 9-verb aliases still resolved:
  - `anchor/reason/integrate/respond/validate/align/forge/audit/seal`

Note: full deprecation lineage is deferred to Phase 2 per your instruction.

## Omega0 and Confidence
