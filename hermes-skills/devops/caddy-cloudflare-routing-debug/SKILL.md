# Caddy Cloudflare Routing Debug Skill

## When to Use
When a route returns HTTP 200 but with HTML 404 body content, or when JSON/well-known routes appear broken. The Cloudflare layer can mask what Caddy is actually doing.

## Core Diagnostic Loop

### Step 1 — Establish what Cloudflare sees
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://target-domain.com/path
```
If this differs from what you expect, check Cloudflare cache rules.

### Step 2 — Bypass Cloudflare, hit Caddy origin directly
```bash
docker exec caddy curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://localhost/path" -H "Host: target-domain.com"
```
This is the **most important technique**. It returns the true Caddy origin response.

### Step 3 — Check if file physically exists in container
```bash
docker exec caddy cat /var/www/html/path/to/file 2>&1 | head -5
docker exec caddy ls -la /var/www/html/path/to/dir/ 2>&1
```

### Step 4 — Examine Caddyfile adapted config
```bash
docker exec caddy caddy adapt --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "
import json, sys
cfg = json.load(sys.stdin)
servers = cfg.get('apps', {}).get('http', {}).get('servers', {})
for name, srv in servers.items():
    for r in srv.get('routes', []):
        for m in r.get('match', []):
            if 'target-host' in str(m):
                print(json.dumps(r, indent=2))
"
```

### Step 5 — Test with explicit Host header + path
```bash
docker exec caddy curl -sL --max-time 5 "http://localhost/.well-known/file.json" -H "Host: domain.com"
```

## Common Caddy v2 Routing Patterns

### `.well-known/*` not served
**Symptom:** `/.well-known/did.json` returns 308 permanent redirect or HTML 404.
**Reason:** Caddy's catch-all `try_files {path} /index.html` handles dot-path routes BEFORE the file_server sees them. The `/000/*` and `/999/*` directives set specific roots but there is no equivalent for `/.well-known/*`.
**Fix:** Add explicit handler before the catch-all:
```
handle /.well-known/* {
    root * /var/www/html/arif/.well-known
    file_server
}
```

### `handle /subdir*` exists but root-level paths return 301 instead of being proxied
**Symptom:** `https://mcp.arif-fazil.com/status.json` returns 301 → redirect to another domain, while `https://mcp.arif-fazil.com/mcp` (POST) returns 405 and works correctly.
**Reason:** Caddy's `handle /mcp*` only matches paths starting with `/mcp`. Paths like `/status.json`, `/health`, `/ready` are NOT under `/mcp` so they fall through to the next `handle` block — typically the catch-all `redir` directive that does a permanent redirect. This is Caddyfile drift: the desired config has explicit handlers for these paths, but the running container's Caddyfile (bind-mounted from host) is missing them.
**Diagnostic:**
```bash
# Step 1 — Confirm what the origin actually returns
curl -sI https://mcp.arif-fazil.com/status.json | grep -E "^HTTP|^location"

# Step 2 — Check live Caddyfile vs local file
docker exec caddy cat /etc/caddy/Caddyfile | grep -A 15 "mcp.arif-fazil.com"
diff $(docker exec caddy cat /etc/caddy/Caddyfile) /root/arifOS/Caddyfile

# Step 3 — Confirm backend is reachable from Caddy (check logs)
docker logs --tail 50 caddy 2>&1 | grep "172.19.0"  # Caddy's IP reaching backends
docker logs --tail 50 arifosmcp 2>&1 | grep "172.19.0"  # arifosmcp receiving requests

# Step 4 — If logs show 405 on /mcp from Caddy's IP, the proxy IS working — the issue is route gaps
```
**Key insight:** 405 on `/mcp` means Caddy IS successfully proxying to arifosmcp and arifosmcp is rejecting GET (correct behavior — `/mcp` is POST-only). If you see 405, the transport layer is fine. The problem is that paths NOT under `/mcp*` are not matched by any `handle` block, so they fall through to the catch-all `redir`.
**Fix:** Add explicit handlers in the site block:
```
mcp.arif-fazil.com {
    handle /mcp* {
        reverse_proxy arifosmcp:8080
    }
    handle /status.json {
        reverse_proxy arifosmcp:8080
    }
    handle /health {
        reverse_proxy arifosmcp:8080
    }
    handle /ready {
        reverse_proxy arifosmcp:8080
    }
    handle {
        redir https://arifos.arif-fazil.com/mcp{uri} permanent
    }
}
```
Then validate and reload:
```bash
docker exec caddy caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
docker exec caddy caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```
**Counterintuitive lesson:** When debugging a proxy that returns 301/308, the instinct is to check network connectivity. But if `handle /mcp*` works (405 on GET = arifosmcp is receiving and rejecting), the backend is reachable. The issue is purely route matching. Check `handle` block coverage before checking `ss`/`netstat`/`iptables`.

### `/*.json` files served as HTML
**Symptom:** `/.well-known/arif-human.json` returns HTTP 200 but with HTML "404: Not Found" body.
**Reason:** File doesn't physically exist on disk at the expected path, so `try_files {path} /index.html` returns `index.html` content — but with HTTP 200.
**Fix:** Either create the JSON file at the correct path, or add a dedicated `handle_path` route that returns the JSON with correct Content-Type.

### `/.well-known/*` returns HTTP 404 from Cloudflare with no cache headers
**Symptom:** `curl -sI https://domain.com/.well-known/file.json` returns `server: cloudflare`, no `cf-ray` → actually this DOES have cf-ray, but NO `cf-cache-status`. Body is "Not Found" from CF edge.
**Distinction:**
- **Cached 404** → has `cf-cache-status: EXPIRED/HIT/MISS`, `age: N` headers. Origin returned 404, CF cached it.
- **Generated 404** → has `server: cloudflare`, NO `cf-cache-status` header. Cloudflare itself is producing the 404 before reaching origin.
**Common causes:**
  - Cloudflare WAF Custom Rule blocking `.well-known` path or any `.json` in dot-folders
  - Page Rule with "Disable Security" not applied to `/.well-known/*`
  - Cloudflare Bot Management / Super Bot Fight Mode blocking dot-file paths
  - CF Zona settings "Always Online" serving stale cached 404
**Fix:** Cloudflare Dashboard → Security → WAF → Custom Rules → look for rules matching `/.well-known/*` or patterns like `*.json` in dotdirs → disable or set to Log. Also check Security → Bots → Bot Fight Mode (can block `.json` paths silently).
**Diagnostic:**
```bash
# Check if Cloudflare is generating or caching the 404
curl -sI "https://domain.com/.well-known/file.json" --max-time 8 | grep -iE "server:|cf-ray|cf-cache-status|age"

# Test origin directly (bypass Cloudflare proxy)
curl -sI "https://72.62.71.199/.well-known/file.json" -H "Host: domain.com" --max-time 8
# If origin returns 200 and CF returns 404 → CF is generating the 404
```

### Nginx upstream DNS name mismatch
**Symptom:** Nginx container in restart loop, logs show `host not found in upstream "container-name:port"`.
**Reason:** Compose `container_name` differs from the hostname referenced in nginx config.
**Fix:** Align nginx upstream host with the actual `container_name` in docker-compose.yml.

## Diagnostic Command Cheatsheet
```bash
# Check container health
docker inspect <container> --format '{{json .State.Health}}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Check live Caddy routes for a host
docker exec caddy caddy adapt --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "
import json,sys; cfg=json.load(sys.stdin)
for n,s in cfg.get('apps',{}).get('http',{}).get('servers',{}).items():
    for r in s.get('routes',[]):
        for m in r.get('match',[]):
            if 'hostname' in str(m): print(json.dumps(r,indent=2))
"

# Test Caddy origin with Host header
docker exec caddy curl -sL -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://localhost/path" -H "Host: domain.com"

# Test Caddy HTTPS origin (from inside container)
docker exec caddy curl -sk -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://localhost/path" -H "Host: domain.com"

# Check file exists in container www root
docker exec caddy ls -la /var/www/html/arif/.well-known/
docker exec caddy cat /var/www/html/arif/.well-known/file.json | wc -c
```

## Key Insight
Caddy's `try_files {path} /index.html` silently returns the `index.html` content with HTTP 200 even when the requested file doesn't exist — it never produces an actual 404 status code for missing files under served paths. This is why "HTTP 200 but HTML 404 body" is the signature of a routing gap, not a missing file.

- **arifOS MCP server port**: Container internal is **8080** (Uvicorn), NOT 3000. Docker host maps 3000→3000 AND 8080→8080 in some compose variants, but the container process itself listens on 8080.
- **Caddyfile proxy port**: Must be `arifosmcp:8080` — pointing to `arifosmcp:3000` produces 502 from Caddy.
- **Active vs desired compose**: `/root/compose/docker-compose.yml` is desired state. `/root/arifOS/deployments/af-forge/docker-compose.yml` is what Docker used to launch the live containers. Find which compose created the running container: `docker inspect arifosmcp --format '{{index .Config.Labels "com.docker.compose.project.config_files"}}'`

## Notes
- Docker mount source `/root/sites` → destination `/var/www/html` in the caddy container.
- Always test origin first before checking Cloudflare settings.
- HTTP 308 from `docker exec caddy curl` means the route exists but is doing a permanent redirect. Use `-L` to follow it and see the final destination.

## Additional Patterns Discovered (2026-04-29)

### Pattern: Empty 200 from Cloudflare when Caddy backend removed

**Symptom:** Domain returns `HTTP/2 200 content-length: 0` — looks like success, actually broken.

**Root cause:** Cloudflare proxies the domain. Caddy's last-known response for that site is cached at the Cloudflare edge (even without explicit cache headers — CF caches empty 200s aggressively). When the Caddy site block is removed, Cloudflare still routes to the origin VPS, but the origin returns nothing, and CF serves its cached empty 200.

**Key diagnostic:**
```bash
# If you see this — Cloudflare is proxying but got an empty cached response
curl -sI https://domain.com/path | grep -E "content-length|cf-cache-status"
# HTTP/2 200
# content-length: 0
# cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC  ← no actual content, just empty cached 200
```

**The fix trap:** Simply reloading Caddy doesn't fix this — Cloudflare keeps serving the cached empty response until its cache expires or you manually purge it. The real fix is one of:

**Option A — Restore Caddy backend:** Put the site block back with a working handler (restore as direct proxy):
```
arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com {
    import tls_origin
    reverse_proxy arifosmcp:8080
}
```
Then purge Cloudflare cache.

**Option B — Remove Cloudflare DNS entirely:** Delete the DNS A/AAAA record for the subdomain so it goes NXDOMAIN. Without Cloudflare proxying, there's nothing to cache.

**Critical lesson:** Removing a Caddy site block WITHOUT removing the Cloudflare DNS record creates a silently broken domain that looks healthy. This is worse than a hard 404 because monitoring checks see 200 and assume everything is fine.

### Pattern: Two Caddyfiles — `/root/compose/Caddyfile` vs `/root/arifOS/Caddyfile`

**Symptom:** You edited `/root/arifOS/Caddyfile` and ran `docker exec caddy caddy reload`, but the route behavior didn't change. Or: you edited one file, it worked, then later the behavior reverted.

**Root cause:** There are TWO Caddyfile sources:
- `/root/arifOS/Caddyfile` — development/designed state
- `/root/compose/Caddyfile` — separate compose deployment
- Container's actual config: `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` — volume-mounted from host

**Which one is the container using?**
```bash
docker inspect caddy --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{.Source}} → {{.Destination}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
# Or:
docker exec caddy cat /etc/caddy/Caddyfile | grep -c "arif"  # compare line count
```

**The pattern:** In this VPS setup, the Caddy container volume-mounts from the host at container start. `caddy reload` reloads the *currently mounted* config. If the host file was edited but Docker was started from a different compose file, the container is running a different config than what you see in `/root/arifOS/Caddyfile`.

**Always verify:** After reloading, check the *actual* running config:
```bash
docker exec caddy cat /etc/caddy/Caddyfile | grep -A5 "target-domain.com"
```

### Pattern: arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com vs mcp.arif-fazil.com — two domains, one backend

**Discovery (2026-04-29):** Two subdomains both pointing to arifOS MCP container:

| Domain | Caddy route | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `mcp.arif-fazil.com` | Explicit handlers for `/mcp`, `/health`, `/status.json`, etc. | ✅ Working canonical |
| `arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com` | Redirect catch-all → `arifos.arif-fazil.com/mcp{uri}` | ⚠️ Deprecated, stale |

**Canonical surface:** `mcp.arif-fazil.com` — documented in arifOS README as the correct endpoint.

**Cleanup rule:** If removing `arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com`, remove BOTH the Caddy block AND the Cloudflare DNS record. Removing only the Caddy block leaves Cloudflare serving cached empty 200s. Removing only the DNS leaves the Caddy block orphaned (harmless but unclean).

**Correct removal sequence:**
1. Remove Cloudflare DNS A/AAAA record for `arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com`
2. Remove the Caddyfile site block
3. Purge Cloudflare cache for the domain
4. Update any docs that reference the old domain
