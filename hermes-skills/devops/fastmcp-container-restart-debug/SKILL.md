# FastMCP Container Restart Loop Debug

## Problem
WEALTH MCP container enters restart loop in Docker Compose. App crashes within seconds of start.

## Root Cause
FastMCP's `mcp.run()` defaults to **stdio transport** — it reads from stdin. When Docker starts the container without a TTY, stdin immediately receives EOF and the process exits cleanly. Docker interprets this as a crash and restarts the container. Loop.

Secondary issue: Compose healthcheck using `pg_isready` or `ss` commands that don't exist inside the WEALTH image.

## Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check if container is restarting**
```bash
docker ps --filter name=<container> --format '{{.Names}} {{.Status}}'
# Look for: "Restarting (N) X seconds ago"
```

2. **Check exit reason**
```bash
docker logs <container> --tail 50
# stdio loop: no output or "INFO: Application startup complete" then silent exit
```

3. **Verify app is running at all**
```bash
docker exec <container> sh -c "cat /proc/1/cmdline" | tr '\0' ' '
docker exec <container> sh -c "which ss 2>/dev/null || which netstat 2>/dev/null"
```

4. **Test transport in isolation**
```bash
docker run --rm --network=host <image> python -c "from internal.monolith import mcp; mcp.run(transport='sse', show_banner=False)" &
sleep 3
curl http://localhost:8000/sse  # should return something (SSE stream or 405)
kill %1 2>/dev/null
```

## The Fix

**Patching `if __name__ == "__main__"` in the monolith/server entrypoint:**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import os
    if os.isatty(0):
        mcp.run()  # stdio for local dev
    else:
        mcp.run(transport="sse", show_banner=False)  # SSE for container
```

This replaces the original `mcp.run()` call. FastMCP's `transport="sse"` makes it bind to HTTP instead of stdio — critical for containers.

## Docker Compose Healthcheck (correct pattern)

After fixing the transport, the healthcheck should test an actual HTTP endpoint:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -sf http://localhost:8000/sse -o /dev/null || exit 1"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 5
```

Note: `curl` must be available in the container. If not, remove healthcheck entirely and rely on `restart: unless-stopped` — the process staying alive is sufficient evidence of health.

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **healthcheck: `pg_isready`** — not in the app container
- **healthcheck: `ss -ltn | grep`** — `ss`/`netstat` often not installed in slim images
- **compose `command:` override for transport** — escaping `import` statements in YAML is fragile
- **`network_mode: service:X`** — too blunt, breaks container networking

## Non-Root Container Python Package Installation

If the container runs as a non-root user (e.g., `USER arifos`), pip cannot write to system site-packages. Packages must be installed to a writable location:

```bash
# Install to /tmp/pylibs (writable by any user)
docker exec <container> sh -c "pip install --target=/tmp/pylibs asyncpg qdrant-client"

# Set PYTHONPATH to include /tmp/pylibs
export PYTHONPATH="/tmp/pylibs:/app"
```

**Startup script pattern** (recommended for non-root containers):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install --target=/tmp/pylibs asyncpg qdrant-client --quiet
export PYTHONPATH="/tmp/pylibs:/app:$PYTHONPATH"
exec python -m arifosmcp.runtime.__main__
```

## Ephemeral /app/ Layer

On some VPS deployments, the docker-compose volume mount target path (e.g., `/usr/src/app/`) does not actually exist inside the container. All code runs from the image's `/app/` layer which is **ephemeral** — fixes to `/app/` survive `docker restart` but NOT `docker rm`.

To make fixes permanent:
1. Update the Dockerfile's `ENTRYPOINT` to use a startup bootstrap script
2. Fix the volume mount path in docker-compose to match actual container code location
3. OR rebuild the image with correct code baked in

## Key Insight

FastMCP defaults to stdio. Container environments have no TTY → stdin closes → process exits → restart loop. Always explicitly set `transport="sse"` when deploying FastMCP containers.
