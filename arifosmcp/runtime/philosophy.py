"""
arifosmcp/runtime/philosophy.py — The arifOS Philosophical Lattice

Architecture: AGI ↔ ASI ↔ APEX Trinity

  AGI Layer — Constitutional Symbols (PHILOSOPHY_REGISTRY / 33 quotes)
    Discrete, interpretable, human-readable, constitutionally curated.
    Each quote is a compact reasoning primitive about reality, suffering,
    power, truth, limits, love, order, and meaning.
    Answers: "What principle can be stated?"
    Used for: floor-failure overrides, stage-based deterministic anchoring.

  ASI Layer — Geometric Intelligence (Qdrant / BGE-M3 / 99-quote manifold)
    Continuous, relational, high-dimensional, geometry-based.
    The embedding manifold organises meaning through proximity, curvature,
    clustering, analogy, and hidden structure — navigating unnamed relations
    across the full corpus without explicit symbolic chains.
    Answers: "What manifold of meaning is closest?"
    Used for: context-aware semantic retrieval from the 99-quote corpus.

  APEX Arbitration — get_wisdom_for_context()
    Governed arbitration between the AGI and ASI layers.
    Floor failures (constitutional overrides) always resolve via the AGI
    layer; semantic context navigates the ASI manifold when available;
    deterministic stage-selection serves as the final fallback.
    Human judge remains sovereign over all verdicts.

    AGI selects from named truths.
    ASI navigates unnamed relations.
    APEX governs which layer speaks.
