# arifOS - DITEMPA, BUKAN DIBERI

*The system that knows because it admits what it cannot know.*

**ARIF mnemonic:** **A**nchor -> **R**eflect -> **I**ntegrate -> **F**orge. This 4-band kernel runs alongside Trinity engines (Delta/Omega/Psi) and the 13 constitutional Floors (F1-F13).

If you're new here, think of arifOS as a **constitutional safety system** for AI. It acts as a **Constitutional Kernel**—meaning it loads a strict set of ethical rules (the 13 Floors) into an AI before it's allowed to take any actions or talk to users.

> **F7 Humility Notice:** arifOS minimizes hallucination and unsafe actions via F2 Truth (τ≥0.99) and F4 Clarity constraints. It does not guarantee perfect detection—see [known limitations](./governance#limitations).

*For experts: arifOS governs AI cognition by loading an entire runtime environment (000->999) between LLMs and real-world tools, featuring thermodynamic grounding via the APEX realization engine.*

## The Execution Model

When you call `init_anchor_state`, arifOS does not just start a session; it **boots the constitutional kernel**. This process:
1.  **Injects System Prompts**: Loads a persistent set of 13-floor instructions and thermodynamic constraints into the agent's context.
2.  **Sets Governance State**: Transitions the environment from a passive oracle to a governed runtime.
3.  **Binds Tool Logic**: Ensures all subsequent tool calls (`reason_mind_synthesis`, `apex_judge_verdict`, etc.) are intercepted by the loaded kernel.

## How arifOS Thinks (The Cognitive Cycle)

arifOS is not a simple filter; it's a careful step-by-step process. Every request flows through this cycle:

## Governance verdicts (How safe is it?)

When arifOS finishes evaluating an AI's thought or action, it returns one of these verdicts. You can see these happening in real-time on our [APEX Sovereign Dashboard](https://arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com/dashboard/).

- **✅ `SEAL`** - Approved. The action passed all 13 constitutional tests and the APEX realization gate.
- **🟡 `PARTIAL`** - Approved with constraints.
- **⚠️ `SABAR`** - Hold/Refine. The AI was hallucinating or taking risks; it must pause and retry.
- **❌ `VOID`** - Blocked. A hard rule (like factual truth or anti-hacking) was violated.
- **🛑 `HOLD-888`** - Mandatory human ratification. The AI is attempting a high-risk action and needs your cryptographic permission.
