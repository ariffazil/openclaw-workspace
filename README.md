## The AAA Mandate: Legal Definition

AAA is the **physiological control plane** of the arifOS organism. It provides the **Legal Definition** of every agent in the federation. While arifOS translates intent into Law, AAA defines the *obligations, permissions, and identity* that allow an agent to exist and act.

### The Five-Layer Stack
In arifOS, "AAA" is a depth-ordered recursive stack:
1. **Functional (Agents · API · Apps)** — How the machine interacts with you.
2. **Security (Auth · Auth · Audit)** — F11/F13 identity and VAULT999 accounting.
3. **Structural (A2A Alignment)** — Mesh coherence; shared truth propagation.
4. **Grade (Triple-A Sovereign)** — Highest governance standard; zero hallucination.
5. **Recursive (AAAA Pattern)** — The fractal ΔΩΨ pattern governing all organs.

## Conceptual Hierarchy (Engineer-to-Engineer)

To prevent ontology drift, we distinguish between the protocol, the behavior, and the actuators:

- **MCP** = The Tool Bus (Protocol for exchange)
- **Skills** = Policy-Execution Behavior (How an agent thinks/acts in a role)
- **Tools** = Concrete Actuators (Shell, File, API, Docker)
- **AAA** = The Governed Control Plane (Governance over all of the above)

## Position in the Sovereign Flow

```
SOUL (Human Δ) → MIND (arifOS Ω) → BODY (AAA/A-FORGE Ψ) → VAULT999 (Seal)
                     ↓               ↑
               Constitutional   Legal Definition
                Translation     & Enforcement
```

AAA sits at the **federation boundary** — it is the registrar of contracts and the gateway for coordinated action.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Role | **Legal Definition** of agents |
| Governing kernel | `arifOS MIND (Ω)` |
| Canonical branch | `main` |
| Repo head audited | `9cbe3d2c` |
| Registry Standard | `Agent Card Schema v1.0` |

## What Changed (2026-05-11)

- arifOS embodiment contracts now gate AAA-routed tool calls at the kernel boundary.
- The control-plane docs were corrected after a prior copy-paste drift in `TODO.md`.
- Discovery surfaces are centered on the A2A gateway under `/.well-known/`.
- Public `/ready` is now part of the live operational truth surface alongside A2A discovery.
- Manual rsync remains the current deploy path; auto-deploy is still the immediate frontier.

## Agent Tier Architecture

| Tier | Agents | Legal Obligation |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **AGI** | OPENCLAW, opencode, hermes-ops | Bounded execution; F1 Reversibility enforced. |
| **ASI** | hermes-asi, hermes | Reasoning synthesis; deep memory; routing logic. |

### Execution Contracts
Every agent in AAA operates under explicit contracts (see `/contracts` and `/schemas`):
- **Agent Card**: Defines identity, tier, and layer-awareness.
- **Layer-Awareness Contract**: Mandates L2 (Security), L3 (Structural), and L4 (Grade) compliance.

## arifOS Federation

arifOS is part of a federated AI governance system. Each organ has a narrow responsibility so no single agent becomes uncontrolled, unaccountable, or self-authorizing.

| Organ | Human Meaning | System Role | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ARIF / APEX** | Final human authority | F13 sovereign veto, approval, override, terminal judgment | [arif-fazil.com](https://arif-fazil.com) |
| **AAA** | Operator cockpit | Identity, A2A federation gateway, session control, agent supervision | [README](https://github.com/ariffazil/AAA) |
| **A-FORGE** | Execution shell | Runs tools, performs dry-runs, executes approved actions, reports outcomes | [README](https://github.com/ariffazil/A-FORGE) |
| **arifOS** | Governance kernel | Checks evidence, risk, authority, verdicts, and auditability before action | [README](https://github.com/ariffazil/arifOS) |
| **GEOX** | Earth intelligence | Seismic, petrophysics, basin, subsurface, and physics-grounded evidence | [README](https://github.com/ariffazil/geox) |
| **WEALTH** | Capital intelligence | NPV, IRR, EMV, risk scoring, crisis triage, economic judgment | [README](https://github.com/ariffazil/wealth) |
| **WELL** | Human readiness mirror | Operator pressure, biological state, cognitive load, human-system safety | [README](https://github.com/ariffazil/well) |
| **Ω-Wiki** | Knowledge base | Persistent compiled knowledge, doctrine, references, and memory surfaces | [wiki.arif-fazil.com](https://wiki.arif-fazil.com) |

### How the organs work together

A governed action should not move directly from prompt to execution.

```
Human / Agent request
→ AAA identifies the session
→ arifOS judges the request
→ GEOX / WEALTH / WELL provide domain evidence when needed
→ A-FORGE executes only approved actions
→ VAULT999 records the receipt
→ APEX / Human can veto at any time
```

> **AAA controls the session. arifOS judges. Domain organs provide evidence. A-FORGE executes. VAULT999 records. The human remains sovereign.**
