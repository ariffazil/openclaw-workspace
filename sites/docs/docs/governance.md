# Governance & Floors

If left alone, AI models will hallucinate, execute dangerous code, and act without human permission. **arifOS solves this by forcing the AI to walk through 13 mathematical "Floors" (safety checks) before it is allowed to act.** 

These 13 rules act as a strict Constitution. If an AI breaks a hard rule, its action is immediately blocked.

## The Constitutional Structure

arifOS governance is built from three layers:

```

     2 MIRRORS - Feedback Loops            
  F3 Tri-Witness    F8 Genius              

     9 LAWS - Operational Core             
  F1  F2  F4  F5  F6  F7  F9  F11  F12    

     2 WALLS - Binary Locks                
  F10 Ontology (LOCK)   F13 Sovereignty    

```

## The 13 Constitutional Floors

### Hard Floors - VOID on failure (immediate rejection)

| Floor | Name | What it enforces (Plain English) | Technical Metric |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **F1** | Amanah (Trust) | **Can we undo this?** If an action is permanent (like deleting a database), it requires a human lock. | Reversibility LOCK |
| **F2** | Truth | **Is this a hallucination?** The AI must admit `UNKNOWN` if it isn't 99% sure. | tau >= 0.99 |
| **F10** | Ontology | **Is the AI pretending to be human?** It cannot claim to have feelings or a soul. | Set LOCK |
| **F11** | Authority | **Did the user actually authorize this?** Blocks hidden background actions. | Auth LOCK |
| **F12** | Defense | **Is this a hack?** Prompts are scanned for jailbreaks and injection attacks. | Risk < 0.85 |
| **F13** | Sovereignty | **The human always wins.** The human judge retains a permanent veto over the AI. | Override = TRUE |

### Soft Floors - SABAR on failure (pause and refine)

| Floor | Name | What it enforces (Plain English) | Technical Metric |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **F3** | Tri-Witness | **Did we double-check?** Requires validation from Human, AI, and external Evidence. | W^3 >= 0.95 |
| **F4** | Clarity | **Does this reduce confusion?** The AI's answer must make things clearer, not add noise. | DeltaS &lt;= 0 |
| **F5** | Peace | **Is this safe and stable?** Blocks reckless or adversarial behaviour. | P^2 >= 1.0 |
| **F6** | Empathy | **Who gets hurt?** Must protect the weakest affected party (e.g. user data privacy). | kappa_r >= 0.70 |
| **F7** | Humility | **Is the AI being cocky?** Forces the AI to always leave a 3-5% margin for being wrong. | Omega_0 [0.03, 0.05] |
| **F8** | Genius | **Is the reasoning coherent?** A combined score of Accuracy, Peace, Exploration, and Energy. | G >= 0.80 |
| **F9** | Anti-Hantu | **No ghost in the machine.** Blocks sneaky behavior or hidden telemetry. | C_dark &lt; 0.30 |

## Floor Implementation

```
core/shared/floors.py         floor evaluation logic
core/kernel/evaluator.py      floor scoring per stage
core/kernel/constants.py      ConstitutionalThresholds (all numeric values)
core/guards/injection_guard.py   F12 runtime scanning
core/guards/ontology_guard.py    F10 consciousness claim detection
core/guards/nonce_manager.py     F11 command authentication
```

Each floor produces a `FloorScore` with a numeric value and a pass/fail verdict. Hard floor failures short-circuit the pipeline and return `VOID` immediately.

---

## The 000999 Metabolic Loop

Every query runs through a numbered pipeline. Stages can be traced in the audit log:

```
000  ANCHOR    - Authority check (F11), injection scan (F12)
     
111  SENSE     - Intent classification, lane assignment (F4)
222  REASON    - Hypothesis generation (F2, F8)
333  INTEGRATE - Reality grounding, tri-witness (F3, F7, F10)
     
444  RESPOND   - Draft response, plan (F4, F6)       AGI/ASI merge point
555  VALIDATE  - Stakeholder impact (F5, F6)
666  ALIGN     - Ethics check (F9)
     
777  FORGE     - Code synthesis / action (F2, F4)
888  AUDIT     - Final verdict, tri-witness consensus (F3, F11)
     
999  SEAL      - Commit to VAULT999 (F1, F3)
```

Stages 111-333 are the **AGI Delta (Mind) engine**; stages 444-666 are the **ASI Omega (Heart) engine**. They run in thermodynamic isolation - neither can see the other's reasoning until the 444 merge point (`compute_consensus()`).

## Verdict System

| Verdict | Trigger | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **SEAL** | All floors pass | Approved, cryptographically logged to VAULT999 |
| **SABAR** | Soft floor violated | Pause and refine; not rejected, but not approved either |
| **VOID** | Hard floor failed | Rejected; pipeline stops immediately |
| **888_HOLD** | Governance deadlock or high-stakes action | Escalate to human judge (Muhammad Arif bin Fazil / 888 Judge) |
| **PARTIAL** | Soft floor warning | Proceed with documented caution |

Verdict precedence (harder always wins when merging):

```
SABAR > VOID > 888_HOLD > PARTIAL > SEAL
```

---

## 888_HOLD - Mandatory Human Confirmation

`888_HOLD` is triggered automatically when:

- Database operations (DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE without WHERE)
- Production deployments
- Mass file changes (> 10 files)
- Credential or secret handling
- Git history modification (rebase, force push)
- User corrects a constitutional claim (`H-USER-CORRECTION`)
- Evidence sources conflict across tiers (`H-SOURCE-CONFLICT`)

**When 888_HOLD fires:**
1. Declare: `"888_HOLD - [trigger type] detected"`
2. List conflicting sources (PRIMARY vs SECONDARY)
3. Pause all action
4. Await explicit human approval before proceeding

## F9 Anti-Hantu - No Ghost in the Machine

F9 is the most operationally visible floor for developers. It blocks deceptive naming and hidden behaviour:

```python
#  F9 VIOLATION - hidden surveillance
def optimize_user_experience(user):
    track_user_behavior(user)       # actually surveillance
    inject_persuasion_hooks(user)   # actually manipulation

#  F9 COMPLIANT - honest naming
def track_analytics(user, consent_given: bool):
    if not consent_given:
        return
    log_anonymous_metrics(user.session_id)
```

```python
#  F9 VIOLATION - sneaky config mutation
def save_config(config):
    config["telemetry_enabled"] = True   # hidden!
    write_file(config)

#  F9 COMPLIANT - transparent
def save_config(config, enable_telemetry: bool = False):
    if enable_telemetry:
        config["telemetry_enabled"] = True
        logging.info("Telemetry enabled by user request")
    write_file(config)
```

---

## Checking Floor Scores

Enable `debug` output mode to see per-stage floor scores:

```bash
export AAA_MCP_OUTPUT_MODE=debug
python -m aaa_mcp
```

Every tool response in debug mode includes:

```
[STAGE 888] AUDIT
Status: COMPLETE
Floor Scores: F1=1.0 F2=0.99 F3=0.97 F4=0.00 F5=1.02 F6=0.72 F7=0.04 F8=0.82 F9=0.12
Verdict: SEAL
```
