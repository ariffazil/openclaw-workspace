# arifOS - The System That Knows It Doesn't Know

> *Ditempa Bukan Diberi* - Forged, Not Given

arifOS is a **constitutional intelligence kernel** for AI agents. It wraps any LLM call - Claude, GPT, Gemini, or your own model - inside a governed pipeline that enforces 13 mathematical floors before a verdict is issued.

**It is not a chatbot, a prompt template, or an AI assistant.** It is the substrate that decides whether a thought is permitted to exist.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing arifOS, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.12+** (strictly required for MCP typing + tool contracts)
- **LLM API keys** set in environment (the kernel wraps the LLM, so it needs the keys):
  ```bash
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."      # For Claude
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."             # For GPT
  export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."                # For Gemini
  ```
- **Optional**: PostgreSQL and Redis for persistent VAULT999 logging

---

## What arifOS Does

**F = Constitutional Floor** - Each F-number represents a mathematical constraint enforced on every LLM call:

| Traditional LLM call | arifOS-governed call |
|:--|:--|
| Model outputs whatever maximises likelihood | Output passes [13 constitutional floors](./governance) first |
| Hallucination is uncaught | [F2 Truth](./governance#the-13-constitutional-floors) >= 0.99 rejects low-evidence claims |
| No audit trail | Every decision logged to immutable VAULT999 |
| No human override point | [F13 Sovereignty](./governance#the-13-constitutional-floors) preserves human veto at all times |
| Claims anything | [F10 Ontology](./governance#the-13-constitutional-floors) locks - no consciousness claims |
| Opaque failures | [888_HOLD](./governance#888_hold---mandatory-human-confirmation) escalates critical decisions to human judge |

## The Governance Pipeline (EMD Stack)

```
Raw Prompt
    

  000_INIT - Session initialization      
  111_AGI - Akal (Intellect) cognition   
  222_ASI - Qalb (Empathy) evaluation    
  444_APEX - Iradah (Authority) verdict  
  999_VAULT - Immutable logging          

    
Governed Output (SEAL / SABAR / VOID)
```

Every query flows through the **Encoder  Metabolizer  Decoder** (EMD Stack):
- **Encoder (000-111)**: Grounds the input in reality
- **Metabolizer (222-777)**: Applies 13 constitutional floors
- **Decoder (888-999)**: Issues verdict with audit trail

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

### 1. Install and Boot

```bash
pip install arifos

# Stdio - for Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenClaw
python -m aaa_mcp

# SSE - for cloud / remote clients
python -m aaa_mcp sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# HTTP (MCP Streamable HTTP)
python -m aaa_mcp http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Or run the unified server (recommended for production):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ariffazil/arifOS.git
cd arifOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py --mode rest   # REST API + SSE + all tools
```

The live endpoint is at **[arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com](https://arifosmcp.arif-fazil.com)** - check `/health` to confirm it is up.

### 2. Wrap Your LLM Call (Python Example)

```python
import requests

# Query through arifOS kernel instead of calling LLM directly
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8889/mcp", json={
    "tool": "reason",
    "params": {
        "query": "Should I invest in cryptocurrency?",
        "context": {"portfolio": "conservative", "risk_tolerance": "low"}
    }
})

result = response.json()
print(f"Verdict: {result['verdict']}")  # SEAL, SABAR, or VOID
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
print(f"Governed Answer: {result['response']}")
```

### 3. Human Override (888 Judge)

When a query hits critical thresholds (high risk, irreversible actions, uncertain evidence), the system returns:

```json
{
  "verdict": "888_HOLD",
  "message": "High-stakes decision requires human review",
  "escalation": "Check Metabolic Console at console.arif-fazil.com",
  "estimated_review_time": "72 hours"
}
```

The **888 Judge** (human operator) reviews via the [Metabolic Console](https://console.arif-fazil.com) and issues the final ruling.

## The Guiding Principle

Most AI systems claim knowing and hide not-knowing.  
arifOS claims knowing **and** admits not-knowing - through constitutional law, not marketing.

**Authority is not power. Authority is knowing the limits and admitting them.**

The 13 floors codify exactly what is known, what is admitted as unknown, and what escalates to the human judge (888_HOLD).
