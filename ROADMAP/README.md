## Overview

This directory consolidates the strategic deep research, roadmaps, and vision documents for arifOS. It covers the current kernel state (v55.2), the gap between claims and reality, and the path forward.

### Master Documents

| Document | What It Is |
|----------|-----------|
| [**MASTER_TODO.md**](./MASTER_TODO.md) | **The Action List.** Every task scored by criticality, timing, energy, risk/reward, and dependencies. Start here. |
| [**ROADMAP_v55_BEYOND.md**](./ROADMAP_v55_BEYOND.md) | **The Tactical Roadmap.** What works, what's broken, version targets (v55.3 through v60+). |
| [**CLAUDE_DEEP_RESEARCH_2026-02-02.md**](./CLAUDE_DEEP_RESEARCH_2026-02-02.md) | **Ground-Truth Gap Analysis.** Codebase audit contrasting all prior research against reality. |

## Current State (Quick Reference)

**What works:** 9 MCP tools, 3 reasoning engines (AGI/ASI/APEX), hard floors (F1,F4,F7,F10,F12), injection defense, schema validation, E2E pipeline test (6/7 pass).

**What's broken:** Soft floors VOID benign queries (kappa_r=0.0 bug), ~60% of tests fail on legacy imports, ledger doesn't persist to disk, L5 agents are `pass` stubs.

**What to do first:** Fix test imports, persist the ledger, fix ASI scoring. Then build agents. See [ROADMAP_v55_BEYOND.md](./ROADMAP_v55_BEYOND.md) for the full priority ladder.

## Strategic Thesis

The AI industry is transitioning from the **Era of Capability** to the **Era of Governance**. arifOS is constitutional infrastructure for this transition — model-agnostic, runtime-enforced, auditable.

> "We are not building a better LLM. We are building the seatbelt for the LLM revolution."

See [ARIFOS_VISION_2030.md](./ARIFOS_VISION_2030.md) for the full market analysis and deployment strategy.
